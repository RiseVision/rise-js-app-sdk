# Rise Node.js SDK

## Public Api V2

This v2 version offers the same functionalities of V1 above except of a different and improved approach that will let you query the RISE apis easily using typescript.

### Coding differences from V1
- In V1 if the network request fails you wouldn't have been able to know it.
- Like [Promises](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/promises)? In V2 you can use them!!

### Other Perks in V2

V2 was completely rewritten in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). You **don't need** to know what TypeScript to leverage some of its benefits such as:
- Code completion: several IDEs such as IntelliJ/WebStorm, sublime and others provide code assist for typescript
- Faster development: thanks to the supporting IDEs, you do not need to remember if that variable is supposed to be a number, an array, or a string. The editor will tell you that. 
- Less errors in your code: thanks to TypeScript your editor will be able to catch errors before running your code!

Also, every method have been commented and annotaded with JsDoc notations to ease your development even more.
